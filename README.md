# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01pE). The goal of this challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card using semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS, matching the design as closely as possible.
